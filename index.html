  <h1>NonTemplate</h1>
  <div class="caption">Not another Python templating language</div>
  
  <h2>Summary</h2>
  
  <ul>
   <li>
     NonTemplate allows you to generate simple XML output directly in your
     <a href="http://python.org">Python</a>
     code with a minimum of syntactic noise.
   </li>
   <li>
    it uses the
    <a href="http://effbot.org/zone/python-with-statement.htm"><tt>with</tt></a>
    statement
    <a href="http://docs.python.org/whatsnew/2.5.html#pep-343-the-with-statement">introduced in Python 2.5</a>
    to ensure that once a tag is opened, it will be closed.
   </li>
   <li>
    Python code and template codes can be interleaved naturally, without
    resorting to restrictive language constructions.  Your favourite debugger
    can see, and set breakpoints in, every level of your template.
   </li>
   <li>
    100% pure Python (&gt;= 2.5), and it works just fine in Python 3.0 as well.
   </li>
   <li>
    Performance is comparable to the commonly used templating languages and is
    better than most.
   </li>
   <li>
    Asyncronous use is easy: NonTemplate is happy reading from iterables and
    writing to IO streams.  This means you can start sending XHTML to your clients
    while your database is still retrieving rows ... 
   </li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Example</h2>
  
<pre class="code">   
import nontemplate

D = nontemplate.document
with D.html():
  D._comment("this is a test")
  with D.head():
    D.title("foo")
  with D.body():
    with D.h1(id="foo"):
      D._text("This is a test")
    with D.table(_class="cool"):
      with D.tbody():
	for row in range(1,11):
	  with D.tr():
	    for col in range(1,11):
	      if row == col:
	        D.td(_class="same")("%d" % row)
	      else:
	        D.td(_class="diff")("%d,%d" % (row,col))
</pre>

  <h2>History</h2>
  
  <p>
   I first used <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/CGI.pm/">CGI.pm</a>
   back in the dawn of Internet time (eg: 1999) and I was impressed by the
   concept of 
   <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/CGI.pm/lib/CGI.pm#CREATING_STANDARD_HTML_ELEMENTS:">embedding HTML code directly in Perl</a>,
   if not the implementation.
   In Python,
   <a href="http://codespeak.net/lxml/lxmlhtml.html#creating-html-with-the-e-factory">lxml.etree's E-factory</a>
   performs a similar job, but greatly restricts your flexibility with branching
   and looping constructs.
  </p>
  
  <p>
   In the meantime, I've wrestled with
   <a href="http://nick.zoic.org/category/programming/web-programming/templating-languages/">all sorts of templating languages in both Perl and Python</a>,
   none of which have proved to be entirely pleasant to deal with.  They each provide a
   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language">DSL</a>
   of sorts, offering more or less complexity at more or less of a distance from the
   'parent' language.
  </p>
  
  <p>
   One aim of template languages has always been to separate "coding" from "web design",
   so that a web designer is not exposed to the full horror of actual code.  The parts
   of the template code which intrude upon the HTML are generally marked up with strange
   punctuation and the web designed could be warned not to touch those parts ... sometimes
   this even worked!  However, in modern practice,
   <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/">Cascading Stylesheets</a> provide a separation
   of content from presentation, rendering this point moot.
  </p>
  
  <p>
   One big inspiration for this project has been wrestling with the really quite daft
   <a href="http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.0/topics/templates/">Django template</a>
   engine.  Just for posterity, my least disliked Python template language is
   <a href="http://www.makotemplates.org/">Mako</a>, mostly because it is the fastest
   of the bunch, and it doesn't reinvent many wheels. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
   In a better world, this work would be in vain, because the only HTML you'd have
   to write would be a wrapper to bootstrap a suitable
   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_%28programming%29">AJAX</a>
   system and everything would be XML or JSON from there.  However, I still find
   myself using template languages with regrettable regularity.
